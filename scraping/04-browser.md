There is some language you will have to understand.

* HTML is the language in which documents on the internet are described
* The DOM is how the browser understands HTML

If you “View source” on a web page you will be able to see see how HTML looks behind any page on the internet. Developer tools in Chrome or Firebug a plugin for Firefox can help you understand the internals of a page by letting you do the following:

* “Inspect element” function lets you understand the HTML of any element you can see on a page.
* Network view shows you all the things that get downloaded when you open a page.
