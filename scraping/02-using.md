## What can I do with it?

---

Some fabulous examples of what you can do with data driven journalism are:

* [Dollars for Docs by Propublica](http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/) - Money taken by doctors by drug companies.
* [Large earthquakes in the Los Angeles area by the LA times](http://graphics.latimes.com/responsivemap-large-earthquakes-los-angeles-area/) - Map of magnitude 4 or higher in the LA area.
* [Mars rover tracker by NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/space/mars-curiosity-rover-tracker.html) - showing what you can do with NASA image data
* [Italy public spending: where does the money go? Openspending embeded by the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/19/italy-public-spending)
* [Gun ownership by ZeitOnline](http://www.zeit.de/2014/04/waffen-deutschland)

Making data more accessible:

* [OpenInterests](http://openinterests.eu/) - Who has financial or political interests in the European institutions?
* [OpenSpending](https://openspending.org/) - OpenSpending exists to “map the money worldwide”
