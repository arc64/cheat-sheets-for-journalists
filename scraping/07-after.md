Once you have the data you will have to clean it up, remove duplicates and analyse it. A place to upload and share your data afterwards is the Open Knowledge Foundations [datahub](http://datahub.io/).

There are plenty more resources including:

* [Veltman's learning lunches explain basic internet concepts](https://github.com/veltman/learninglunches)
* [Scraping for Journalists](https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists)
* [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org)
* [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org)
* [Search-Script-Scrape 101](https://github.com/stanfordjournalism/search-script-scrape)


Beyond the scope of this walk through are more complex scraping methods with [Kimono](http://www.kimonolabs.com/), [morph.io](morph.io), [Scraperwiki](https://scraperwiki.com/) or scraping with code using; Python, Beautiful Soup, Scrapy etc.
